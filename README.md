# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-DS-PBL

## Overview
- Detection of a fraudulent credit card transaction can be helped by a number of factors such as the time and amount of the transaction.

- In this project, we build classification models to predict whether a credit card transaction is authentic or fraudulent, based on the data regarding time, amount and a set of PCA-transformed features for a large number of transactions.

- A detailed exploratory data analysis on the dataset is carried out.
